# Gitter IRC Bridge

Connect to Gitter using the IRC protocol.

## Running the server

You'll need a working Node.js environment.

 * Install the dependencies with: `npm install`
 * Start the server with: `npm start`

## Configuring your client

You'll need to provide a valid token to authenticate yourself. You can send your token to the server using the `/PASS` command. If you use a GUI client, this is the Server Password; your client will send it automatically on connection.

You can obtain your token from https://irc.gitter.im
